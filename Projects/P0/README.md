4. Clone your repository using ssh ```git clone git@...```

Once you have cloned the remote repository, checkout the setup branch

edit the main README and add your name as one of the lines. Then add, commit, and push your changes:

## Checking Your Java Installation

We will also be using JUnit Tests in this class. Run the following commands to test that you can run and compile JUnit tests:

```bash
cd path_to_repo/Projects/P0
javac -cp "junit-4.10.jar:." TestHelloWorld.java 
java -cp "junit-4.10.jar:." org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestHelloWorld
```

## Academic Integrity

Please **carefully read** the academic honesty section of the course syllabus. **Any evidence** of impermissible cooperation on projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized use of computer accounts, **will be** submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or suspension or expulsion from the University. Be sure you understand what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to academic integrity when it comes to project assignments. These policies apply to all students, and the Student Honor Council does not consider lack of knowledge of the policies to be a defense for violating them. Full information is found in the course syllabus, which you should review before starting.
